# Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in detail?

This is an interesting TED conference given by Matt Walker, a brain and sleep scientist, who in his searching for understanding why we sleep; he clarifies in his talk a variety of important facts about sleep.
Firstly, he mentioned the importance that sleep has in the sexual and reproductive life of human beings. He clarifies that males could suffer of premature ageing and females could have issues in their reproductive health if they do not sleep. Additionally, the speaker mentioned the alarmingly bad things that happen when we do not get enough, for both brain and our body.

Regarding to brain activity and the functions of learning, he and his colleagues did a research trying to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea. So, they took a group of individuals and they assigned them to one of two experimental groups: a sleep group, and a sleep deprivation group. Then the next day, the participants were tested inside an MRI scanner for evaluation of the brain activity. The found was quite significant related to effective sleep and learning, it showed 40% deficit in learning abilities and no capability of making new memories in patients who were lacking of sleep.

He concluded saying the famous quotation “The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life” saying that indeed is it true and providing some helpful tips for getting some shut-eye: “Regularity is king”, “Keep it cool” a room temperature of 18°C is beneficial for most people, and most important “Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity. It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature’s best effort yet at immortality”.

## Enhancement of Cognitive Abilities:
Exercise has the potential to improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills.
## Neuroplasticity Boost:
Regular exercise seems to stimulate neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself.
## Mitigation of Stress and Anxiety:
Engaging in physical activities can release endorphins, which are natural mood enhancers.
## Promotion of Brain Health:
Regular physical exercise may lead to increased blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain.
