## Q 3.Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines in your own words.
**Fixed Mindset:**
People with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits and cannot be significantly developed or changed. They tend to see their qualities as inherent and unchangeable. Therefore, they may avoid challenges to protect their self-esteem, fear failure, and view effort as fruitless. When faced with setbacks or obstacles, individuals with a fixed mindset may give up easily, feeling discouraged and disheartened. They might also compare themselves to others and feel threatened by others' successes, as if there is a limited amount of success or talent available.

**Growth Mindset:**
On the other hand, people with a growth mindset believe that their abilities can be developed and improved through dedication, hard work, and learning. They see challenges as opportunities to grow and thrive. Instead of seeing failure as a reflection of their abilities, they view it as a chance to learn and improve. Individuals with a growth mindset embrace effort and persist in the face of difficulties. They are more likely to seek out feedback and see the success of others as inspiration, rather than feeling threatened. A growth mindset leads to a love of learning and a willingness to take on new challenges without being held back by the fear of failure.

In summary, fixed mindset people tend to believe that their qualities are static, leading to a desire to avoid challenges and a reluctance to put in effort. On the other hand, growth mindset people believe that their qualities can be developed, leading to a more resilient and adaptive approach to challenges and a greater willingness to embrace effort and learning. Developing a growth mindset can be beneficial for personal and professional growth, as it fosters a belief in one's potential for continuous improvement and the motivation to reach higher levels of achievement.
