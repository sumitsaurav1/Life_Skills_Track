# Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg that focuses on creating lasting change through small, incremental habits.
## Behavioral Change Through Small Steps:
One of the key takeaways from BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits" concept is that creating lasting behavioral change doesn't require massive, overwhelming efforts. Instead, by starting with tiny, easily achievable habits, you can build momentum and create positive changes over time. 
## Anchor Habits in Existing Routines:
Fogg emphasizes the importance of anchoring new habits in existing routines or triggers. This means attaching a new behavior to something you already do consistently. For instance, if you want to establish a habit of doing push-ups, you might anchor it to brushing your teeth in the morning.
## Embrace Simplicity and Consistency: 
Fogg's approach underscores the power of simplicity. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine, focus on one small habit at a time. Consistency is key - the easier the habit, the more likely you are to stick with it.
## Behavior Follows Motivation and Ability: 
According to Fogg's Behavior Model, for a behavior to occur, you need both motivation and ability. If a behavior is difficult, even high motivation might not be enough. So, the key is to make behaviors easier to perform, which increases the likelihood of them becoming habits.
# How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?


The Fogg Behavior Model is a model for analysing and designing human behaviour. It states that we can only achieve behaviour change when three elements occur simultaneously. These elements are motivation, ability and a trigger.

People need to be motivated to change their behaviour. However, they must also have the ability to do the behaviour. Lastly, they have to be triggered to do the behaviour. If one of these elements is missing, we cannot achieve behaviour change.


Behavior (B) = Motivation (M) Ability (A) Trigger (T)

In fact, the model makes it easier to understand behaviour change in general by highlighting its three principal elements, each of which has subcomponents.

## Motivation:
The first component, motivation, considers the underlying drivers that motivate us to take action.

As the graph for the model illustrates, the vertical axis represents motivation. It goes from low to high motivation. The higher the motivation, the more likely you are to complete an action.

However, motivation and ability can be traded off. In other words, if your motivation is very high, your ability can be lower, and vice versa.

Motivation is a large and complicated subject in its own right. For the purposes of his model, Fogg breaks it down into three subcomponents. These are sensation, anticipation and belonging.

## Ability
Simplify the behavior to make it easier to perform. The key is to make it so simple that it requires minimal effort. For the water-drinking habit, you might place a glass of water on your bedside table the night before, making it incredibly easy to do first thing in the morning.
## Prompt: 
Linking the behavior to your existing morning routine of getting out of bed.

By applying B = MAP, you're breaking down the process of creating a new habit into manageable steps. This approach helps you increase motivation, simplify the behavior, and integrate it into your existing routine. Over time, these small habits can accumulate and lead to larger positive changes in your life.

# Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebrating or "shining" after each successful completion of a habit is an important psychological strategy that can greatly enhance the habit formation process. Here's why it's important
## Positive Reinforcement: 
Celebrating your successes provides a positive reinforcement for the behavior you're trying to establish. When you associate a positive and pleasurable experience with completing a habit, your brain begins to link that behavior with positive feelings. This reinforcement makes you more likely to repeat the behavior in the future.
## Builds Momentum: 
Consistently celebrating your achievements creates a momentum that carries you forward. Each successful completion reinforces the belief that you are capable of achieving your goals, making it easier to maintain the habit over time.
## Mindfulness:
Celebrations force you to pause and acknowledge your effort and progress. This mindfulness helps you stay present and appreciative of the journey rather than just focusing on the end goal.

## Stress Reduction:
Celebrations provide a break from the monotony and stress of daily routines. They allow you to step away from work or other obligations and indulge in something enjoyable, reducing stress and promoting well-being.

# 1% Better Every Day Video
Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.
—Jim Rohn
## Evolutionary, Not Revolutionary Change
When thinking about “change,” you might imagine a change initiative or some other big shift that requires big, disruptive adjustments in order to get meaningful results.
## Doing More of the Things That Work
Instead of looking into a totally new method or practice, start by focusing on the things you already know work – and be consistent in doing those things.

For example, are there certain practices you’ve found that make your daily meetings more productive? Make sure you follow those practices every day, instead of sporadically.

## Eliminating the Things That Don’t Work
The inversion of “doing more of what works” is just as true: make sure you identify things that lead to a loss.

In the example of the British cyclists, Brailsford knew that if the team mates had a less than optimal night’s sleep, it would affect their performance the next day.
## Contagious Enthusiasm
What’s great about the 1% approach to continuous improvement is that it’s doable and rewarding. When you see the results of your efforts pay off, it leads to an upward-cycling pattern of motivation.

In the words of Sir Dave Brailsford himself:
#Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

"Atomic Habits" by James Clear is a highly regarded book that delves into the science and art of habit formation, aiming to provide practical insights into how to build good habits and break bad ones. The book emphasizes that making tiny changes, or improving by just 1% every day, can lead to remarkable transformations over time. Here's how the book addresses habit formation through the lenses of identity, processes, and outcomes:
## Identity:
The book argues that lasting habit change comes from identifying with the desired behavior. Clear suggests that rather than focusing solely on outcomes, individuals should focus on becoming the type of person who naturally engages in the desired behavior. This shift to an identity-based approach to habits is pivotal. For instance, instead of setting a goal to "lose 10 pounds," the book suggests embracing the identity of a healthy person who prioritizes physical well-being. 
## Processes:
Clear emphasizes the importance of processes over goals. He introduces the concept of "habit stacking," which involves tying new habits to existing ones, making it easier to incorporate them into daily routines. The book also highlights the idea of "implementation intentions," which involve planning out when and where a specific behavior will occur. By focusing on the process of habit formation, the book suggests that one can increase the odds of sticking to positive behaviors.

## Outcomes:
While outcomes are important, "Atomic Habits" argues that focusing solely on results can be counterproductive. The book suggests that true behavior change is a byproduct of small, consistent actions. Instead of being fixated on achieving an end goal, the book encourages individuals to pay attention to the systems and processes that lead to those outcomes. In other words, concentrating on the inputs often leads to improved outputs.
# Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?
## Environment Design: 
Clear emphasizes that your environment plays a crucial role in shaping your behavior. By altering your surroundings to make good habits more visible and convenient, you can increase the chances of following through. For instance, if you want to eat healthier, keep healthy snacks readily available and place them within easy reach.
## Habit Stacking: 
This technique involves attaching a new habit to an existing one. By linking a habit you want to build with something you already do consistently, you create a natural trigger. For instance, if you want to establish a habit of doing push-ups, you could commit to doing them right after brushing your teeth.
## Implementation Intentions:  
This strategy involves planning out when and where you will perform a new habit. Being specific about the time and location increases the likelihood of execution. For example, rather than saying "I'll exercise more," say "I'll go for a 20-minute walk every morning after breakfast."
# Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?
"Atomic Habits" by James Clear not only focuses on building good habits but also provides insights into how to break bad habits by making them more difficult to perform. Clear suggests that by introducing friction and obstacles to undesirable behaviors, you can reduce their appeal and increase the chances of quitting them. Here are some key points from the book regarding this perspective:
## Increase Friction:
 Clear recommends adding steps that make it harder to engage in a bad habit. For instance, if you're trying to cut down on social media usage, log out of your accounts after each session. This extra step of logging in every time adds friction and prompts you to reconsider the habit.
 ## Time Delay:
 Introduce a time delay between the urge to engage in the bad habit and its execution. This pause allows you to consider whether the action is aligned with your goals. For example, if you're tempted to eat unhealthy snacks, commit to waiting for 10 minutes before indulging. Often, the urge will pass during this waiting period.
 ## Change the Environment: 
 Alter your surroundings to discourage the behavior. If you're trying to reduce TV time, unplug the TV or place it in a less accessible location. This extra effort can deter you from mindlessly engaging in the bad habit.

 #Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

 Celebrating our successes, even the small ones, can be a great way to reinforce positive behavior and boost your motivation. Celebrations create a sense of accomplishment and add an element of enjoyment to our journey towards your goals. Here are some tips on how to effectively celebrate our successes

 # Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?


The habit I want to cultivate is consistent and focused coding practice. To make this habit more effective and sustainable, I'll follow a strategy based on the principles of habit formation:
## Cue:
Create a designated coding space and time. Have a dedicated desk or workspace where I code, ideally free from distractions. Set a regular schedule for coding sessions, whether it's daily, every other day, or a few times a week.
## Attractive: 
Make coding appealing and enjoyable. Choose coding projects that align with my interests and goals. Explore diverse projects to keep things exciting. Join coding communities, forums, or social media groups to connect with fellow programmers and share progress, challenges, and accomplishments.
## Easy:
Remove barriers and make it easy to start coding. Keep my coding environment organized and set up with necessary tools and resources (IDE, libraries, documentation, etc.). Break down larger projects into smaller tasks to prevent feeling overwhelmed. Always have a simple coding exercise or mini-project ready for days when time is limited.
## Accountability:
 Set goals and track progress. Define short-term and long-term coding objectives. Keep a coding journal to jot down ideas, solutions, and reflections. Use version control (like Git) to manage projects and see the evolution of my code over time.
 # Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
 The habit I want to eliminate or reduce is eating fast food. To break this habit, I'll apply strategies to make it less appealing and less convenient:
 ## Learn About Nutritional Impact: 
 Educate myself about the negative health consequences of regular fast food consumption. Understanding the impact on my well-being can be a strong deterrent.
 ## Find Alternatives: 
 Discover tasty and healthier alternatives to fast food. Explore new recipes and cuisines that are both satisfying and nourishing.
 ## Mindful Eating:
 When I do eat fast food, eat mindfully and pay attention to how it makes me feel afterward. Recognize that it often leaves me feeling less satisfied than a healthier meal.
